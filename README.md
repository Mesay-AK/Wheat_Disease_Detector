# Wheat-Disease-Recognition

WheatGuard is a mobile application that helps farmers, agricultural practitioners and alike to detect wheat crop diseases. Our project uses a Convulational Neural Networks(CNN) to detect if a wheat crop is healthy or not. By using the model, the application tries to classify a crop image from the application into four major classes ('Leaf rust', 'Crown root rot', 'Loose smut', 'healthy'). If the image is not classified as one of these classes, it is identified as 'Unknown class'. We used DDD-like architecture to structure our code.

Packages Used for the Application
1. Flutter BLoC - For state management
2. GoRouter - For Navigation
3. TFLite - For model integration
